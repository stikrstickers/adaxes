SYNTAX
    Remove-AdmPrincipalGroupMembership [-Identity] <Object> [-MemberOf] <Object[]> [-AdaxesService <string>] 
    [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-Partition <string>] [-PassThru <switch>] [-Server <string>] [-Confirm] 
    [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The Remove-AdmPrincipalGroupMembership cmdlet removes a user, group, computer, service account, or any other 
    account object from one or more Active Directory groups.
    
    The Identity parameter specifies the user, group, or computer to remove. You can identify the user, group, or 
    computer by its distinguished name (DN), GUID, security identifier (SID) or SAM account name. You can also 
    specify a user, group, or computer object variable, such as $<localGroupObject>, or pass an object through 
    the pipeline to the Identity parameter. For example, you can use the Get-AdmUser cmdlet to retrieve a user 
    object and then pass the object through the pipeline to the Remove-AdmPrincipalGroupMembership cmdlet. 
    Similarly, you can use Get-AdmGroup or Get-AdmComputer to get group, service account and computer objects to 
    pass through the pipeline.
    
    This cmdlet collects all of the user, computer, service account and group objects from the pipeline, and then 
    removes these objects from the specified group by using one Active Directory operation.
    
    The MemberOf parameter specifies the groups that you want to remove the member from. You can identify a group 
    by its distinguished name (DN), GUID, security identifier (SID) or Security Accounts Manager (SAM) account 
    name. You can also specify a group object variable, such as $<localGroupObject>. To specify more than one 
    group, use a comma-separated list. You cannot pass group objects through the pipeline to the MemberOf 
    parameter. To remove a member from groups that are passed through the pipeline, use the Remove-AdmGroupMember 
    cmdlet.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AdaxesService <string>
        Specifies the DNS name of an Adaxes service that will be used to execute this cmdlet. If this parameter 
        is not specified, and the cmdlet is running from an Adaxes Active Directory provider drive, the value for 
        this parameter can be determined from the current path. For example, if the current path is 
        "Adaxes:/example.com", the Adaxes service on "example.com" will be used. If the parameter is not 
        specified and the service DNS name can't be determined from the current path, the cmdlet will access 
        Active Directory directly.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Credential <PSCredential>
        Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task. The default credentials are the 
        credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Active Directory PowerShell 
        provider drive. If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with the drive is 
        the default one.
        
        To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as "User1" or "Domain01\User01" or you can 
        specify a PSCredential object. If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a 
        password.
        
        You can also create a PSCredential object by using a script or by using the Get-Credential cmdlet. You 
        can then set the Credential parameter to the PSCredential object The following example shows how to 
        create credentials.
        $AdminCredentials = Get-Credential "Domain01\User01"
        
        The following shows how to set the Credential parameter to these credentials.
        -Credential $AdminCredentials
        
        If the acting credentials do not have directory-level permission to perform the task, Active Directory 
        PowerShell returns a terminating error.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Identity <Object>
        Specifies an Active Directory principal object by providing one of the following property values. The 
        identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
        
        Distinguished Name
        Example:  CN=SaraDavis,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com
        GUID (objectGUID)
        Example: 599c3d2e-f72d-4d20-8a88-030d99495f20
        Security Identifier (objectSid)
        Example: S-1-5-21-3165297888-301567370-576410423-1103
        SAM Account Name (sAMAccountName)
        Example: saradavis
        
        The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object. If two or more objects 
        are found, the cmdlet returns a non-terminating error.
        
        This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object 
        instance.
        
        Derived types, such as the following are also accepted:
        - Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADGroup
        - Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADUser
        - Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADComputer
        - Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADServiceAccount
        
        This example shows how to set the parameter to a distinguished name.
        -Identity  "CN=saradavis,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com"
        
        This example shows how to set this parameter to a principal object instance named "principalInstance".
        -Identity $principalInstance
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    1
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       true (ByValue)
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -MemberOf <Object[]>
        Specifies the Active Directory groups to remove a user, computer, or group from. You can identify a group 
        by providing one of the following values. Note: The identifier in parentheses is the LDAP display name 
        for the attribute.
        
        Distinguished Name
        Example: CN=saradavisreports,CN=europe,CN=users,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com
        GUID (objectGUID)
        Example: 599c3d2e-f72d-4d20-8a88-030d99495f20
        Security Identifier (objectSid)
        Example: S-1-5-21-3165297888-301567370-576410423-1103
        Security Accounts Manager (SAM) Account Name (sAMAccountName)
        Example: saradavisreports
        
        If you are specifying more than one group, use commas to separate the groups in the list.
        
        The following example shows how to specify this parameter by using SAM account name values.
        -MemberOf "SaraDavisGroup", "JohnSmithGroup"
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    2
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Partition <string>
        Specifies the distinguished name of an Active Directory partition. The distinguished name must be one of 
        the naming contexts on the current directory server. The cmdlet searches this partition to find the 
        object defined by the Identity parameter.
        The following two examples show how to specify a value for this parameter.
        -Partition "CN=Configuration,DC=EUROPE,DC=TEST,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM"
        
        -Partition "CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=EUROPE,DC=TEST,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM"
        
        In many cases, a default value will be used for the Partition parameter if no value is specified.  The 
        rules for determining the default value are given below.  Note that rules listed first are evaluated 
        first, and once a default value can be determined, no further rules will be evaluated.
        
        In AD DS environments, a default value for Partition will be set in the following cases:  - If the 
        Identity parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of Partition is automatically 
        generated from this distinguished name.
        - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of Partition is 
        automatically generated from the current path in the drive.
        - If none of the previous cases apply, the default value of Partition will be set to the default 
        partition or naming context of the target domain.
        
        In AD LDS environments, a default value for Partition will be set in the following cases:
        - If the Identity parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of Partition is 
        automatically generated from this distinguished name.
        - If running cmdlets from an Active Directory provider drive, the default value of Partition is 
        automatically generated from the current path in the drive.
        - If the target AD LDS instance has a default naming context, the default value of Partition will be set 
        to the default naming context.  To specify a default naming context for an AD LDS environment, set the 
        msDS-defaultNamingContext property of the Active Directory directory service agent (DSA) object (nTDSDSA) 
        for the AD LDS instance.
        - If none of the previous cases apply, the Partition parameter will not take any default value.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -PassThru <switch>
        Returns the new or modified object. By default (i.e. if -PassThru is not specified), this cmdlet does not 
        generate any output.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Server <string>
        Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following 
        values for a corresponding domain name or directory server. The service may be any of the following:  
        Active Directory Lightweight Domain Services, Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory 
        Snapshot instance.
        Domain name values:
        Fully qualified domain name
        Examples: corp.contoso.com
        NetBIOS name
        Example: CORP
        
        Directory server values:
        Fully qualified directory server name
        Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com
        NetBIOS name
        Example: corp-DC12
        Fully qualified directory server name and port
        Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com:3268
        
        The default value for the Server parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order 
        that they are listed:
        -By using Server value from objects passed through the pipeline.
        -By using the server information associated with the Active Directory PowerShell provider drive, when 
        running under that drive.
        -By using the domain of the computer running Powershell.
        
        The following example shows how to specify a fully qualified domain name as the parameter value.
        -Server "corp.contoso.com"
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]
        Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.
        
        Required?                    false

        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]
        Describes what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
