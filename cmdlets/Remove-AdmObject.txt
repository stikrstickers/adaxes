NAME
    Remove-AdmObject
    
SYNOPSIS
    Removes an Active Directory object.
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-AdmObject [-Identity] <Object> [-AdaxesService <string>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-Partition 
    <string>] [-Recursive <switch>] [-Server <string>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The Remove-AdmObject cmdlet removes an Active Directory object. You can use this cmdlet to remove any type of 
    Active Directory object.
    
    The Identity parameter specifies the Active Directory object to remove. You can identify an object by its 
    distinguished name (DN) or GUID. You can also set the Identity parameter to an Active Directory object 
    variable, such as $<localObject>, or pass an object through the pipeline to the Identity parameter. For 
    example, you can use the Get-AdmObject cmdlet to retrieve an object and then pass the object through the 
    pipeline to the Remove-AdmObject cmdlet.
    
    If the object you specify to remove has child objects, you must specify the Recursive parameter.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AdaxesService <string>
        Specifies the DNS name of an Adaxes service that will be used to execute this cmdlet. If this parameter 
        is not specified, and the cmdlet is running from an Adaxes Active Directory provider drive, the value for 
        this parameter can be determined from the current path. For example, if the current path is 
        "Adaxes:/example.com", the Adaxes service on "example.com" will be used. If the parameter is not 
        specified and the service DNS name can't be determined from the current path, the cmdlet will access 
        Active Directory directly.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Credential <PSCredential>
        Specifies the user account credentials to use to perform this task. The default credentials are the 
        credentials of the currently logged on user unless the cmdlet is run from an Adaxes Active Directory 
        PowerShell provider drive. If the cmdlet is run from such a provider drive, the account associated with 
        the drive is the default one.
        
        To specify this parameter, you can type a user name, such as "User1" or "Domain01\User01" or you can 
        specify a PSCredential object. If you specify a user name for this parameter, the cmdlet prompts for a 
        password.
        
        You can also create a PSCredential object by using a script or by using the Get-Credential cmdlet. You 
        can then set the Credential parameter to the PSCredential object The following example shows how to 
        create credentials.
        $AdminCredentials = Get-Credential "Domain01\User01"
        
        The following shows how to set the Credential parameter to these credentials.
        -Credential $AdminCredentials
        
        If the acting credentials do not have permission to perform the task, Adaxes Active Directory PowerShell 
        returns a terminating error.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Identity <Object>
        Specifies an Active Directory object by providing one of the following property values. The identifier in 
        parentheses is the LDAP display name for the attribute.
        
        Distinguished Name
        Example: CN=saradavis,OU=users,OU=asia,DC=corp,DC=contoso,DC=com
        GUID (objectGUID)
        Example: 599c3d2e-f72d-4d20-8a88-030d99495f20
        
        The cmdlet searches the default naming context or partition to find the object. 
        
        This parameter can also get this object through the pipeline or you can set this parameter to an object 
        instance.
        
        Derived types, such as the following are also accepted:
        Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADGroup
        Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADUser
        Softerra.Adaxes.PowerShellModule.Directory.ADComputer
        
        This example shows how to set this parameter to an ADObject object instance named "ADObjectInstance".
        -Identity   $ADObjectInstance
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    1
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       true (ByValue)
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Partition <string>
        Specifies the distinguished name of an Active Directory partition. The distinguished name must be one of 
        the naming contexts on the current directory server. The cmdlet searches this partition to find the 
        object defined by the Identity parameter.
        The following two examples show how to specify a value for this parameter.
        -Partition "CN=Configuration,DC=EUROPE,DC=TEST,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM"
        
        -Partition "CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=EUROPE,DC=TEST,DC=CONTOSO,DC=COM"
        
        In many cases, a default value will be used for the Partition parameter if no value is specified.  The 
        rules for determining the default value are given below.  Note that rules listed first are evaluated 
        first, and once a default value can be determined, no further rules will be evaluated.
        
        - If the Identity parameter is set to a distinguished name, the default value of Partition is 
        automatically generated from this distinguished name.
        - If running cmdlets from an Adaxes Active Directory provider drive, the default value of Partition is 
        automatically generated from the current path in the drive.
        - If none of the previous cases apply, the default value of Partition will be set to the default 
        partition or naming context of the target domain.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Recursive <switch>
        Specifies that the cmdlet should remove the object and any children it contains.
        
        The following example shows how to specify this parameter.
        -Recursive
        
        Note: Specifying this parameter will remove all child objects even if there are objects marked with 
        ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Server <string>
        Specifies the Active Directory Domain Services instance to connect to, by providing one of the following 
        values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.
        Domain name values:
        Fully qualified domain name
        Examples: corp.contoso.com
        NetBIOS name
        Example: CORP
        
        Directory server values:
        Fully qualified directory server name
        Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com
        NetBIOS name
        Example: corp-DC12
        Fully qualified directory server name and port
        Example: corp-DC12.corp.contoso.com:3268
        
        The default value for the Server parameter is determined by one of the following methods in the order 
        that they are listed:
        -By using Server value from objects passed through the pipeline.
        -By using the server information associated with the Adaxes Active Directory PowerShell provider drive, 
        when running under that drive.
        -By using the domain of the computer running Powershell.
        
        The following example shows how to specify a fully qualified domain name as the parameter value.
        -Server "corp.contoso.com"
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false

        Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]
        Describes what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
